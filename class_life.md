How is your listening? If you listen for keywords you can often get enough of the sentence to be able to understand through context. Let's try some tasks that involve your listening skill!

Vocabulary words are the building blocks of your new language. The more words you know the better you can express yourself and understand other people. We're going to practice vocabulary with these new few tasks. Are you ready to apply what you've learned?

Reading improves your vocabulary and gives you a sense of how words fit together. Don't read the word individually, but get a sense of how the words and sentences fit in with what the author is talking about.

Can you master keys words, phrases, sentence patterns, and analysis the structure of the text? You have to grasp the meaning of a sentence in order to communicate. That's why we'll do some tasks to practice looking at words in sentences and expressions.

The more you practice speaking, the easier it will become. Imagine the interesting people you can talk to and impress with your vocabulary and quick wit! Are you prepared? Speak as accurately as you can in the next tasks.

For long conversations and talks, you must pay careful attention to both the main idea and details. If you find a phrase to be very difficult, break it into sections and repeat it piece by piece. Maybe you won't find that it's so hard after all!! Let's move on!

Let's move on to this sentence scramble.


Let's see how closely you were listening by testing you in this exercise.


Let's work on some tasks that will improve your writing ability! A big part of writing is making sure words flow naturally from one idea to the next. As we work on writing, you'll get a feel for how a good piece of writing flows.


Notice how that essay was structured -- one main idea, which was backed up by examples proving that main idea. It's not enough just to say something -- you have to prove it with examples. Let's first practice with an exercise.

It's time for another essay. Don't worry; you're going to do great! Remember to stat what you think and then back it up with good reasons. If you do this, you'll build a very convincing case. Good luck!

## Level 2

### Weather and Climate

How has the weather been recently? Can you describe your local climate? Let me tell you a bit about mine. **Spring is comfortable. Summer is hot, but rarely humid. Autumn is clear and bright. Winter is crisp and clean.**

 
 You can say, "it is raining cats and dogs", if it's raining very heavy. Or you can also make sentences like: "We can't go now because it's raining cats and dogs." **You know, I really don't mind rain that much. Falling asleep to rain is actually quite enjoyable.** Try to describe the weather and understand the weather forecast on the news.
 

The temperature will drop in a few days.

The weather can really affect my mind. I tend to be more thoughtful during rainy days and happier when it's sunny. Does the weather affect your emotions?

People have been trying to forecast the weather for thousands of years. While in the past people looked at clouds and felt the wind, today we also have advanced tools to track the weather. Let's look at this news story about weather forecasting.


#### Weather Forecasting from Myth to Science
As unpredictable as the weather is very common saying but it's not completely true.

The ancient Greeks gave it a shot 300 years later.

Red sky in the morning, sailor's warning; red sky at night, sailor's delight.

The need for accuracy in weather predictions is great for many industries. Airlines need up-to-date weather reports in order to avoid dangerous weather. Farmers rely on forecasts in order to plan daily work as well as planting and harvesting schedules.


#### Seasons

Spring is beautiful but rainy, and summer is relaxing but so hot! We like different seasons for different reasons. What is your favorite season and why? I like autumn because I like watching the leaves change colour and cover the ground. Which season is your favorite?



### Travel

This morning, I could have ridden a scooter, taken the subway, or ridden a bus. The great thing about a city is that there are so many ways to travel.


How do you usually get around? I use the subway because it's quick and I don't have to worry about parking.


What's your favourite form of transportation? Sometimes I wish I had a helicopter to take me wherever I needed. That way I could just soar above all the traffic. 


There are various types of transportation including air, ground and rail. Subways and public transportation are the centre of major city operations. Let's keep working on transportation words. How many different types of transportation can you name now? Keep naming things as you see them.


This morning, the subway was so crowed I was almost crushed! What is the best way to commute? Each method of transportation has advantages and disadvantages. Let's learn how to describe them in today's lesson.


Which transportation methods do you prefer? Can you think of the disadvantages in the way you usually travel? Hopefully you think it's worth the trouble. 


I think I prefer in a place with a well-developed public transportation system. A lot of people get around the city by subway and buses. What is your main method of transportation and way? Is it comfortable, convenient, or just cool?


### Convenience

Convenience stores are truly there to make our lives more convenient. They're accessible and sell many of the things we need at a low price. Let's learn some words that will make it more convenient for you at the convenience store.


A convenience store is a small store or shop that may sell items such as sweets, ice-cream, soft drinks, lottery tickets, cigarettes, newspapers and magazine, and perhaps some groceries. There's no place on Earth that has as many convenience stores as Taiwan.

## Level 3


### Sports

My brother likes very old-fashioned sports, like horseback riding and archery. Do you play any sports? What activities do you like to do best? Today we're going to learn some words for adventurous activities.


In the winter, my friends and I go up to a ski resort. It's always a lot of fun to ski and snowboard during the day and gather around the fireplace at night. Do you prefer winter sports or summer sports? Let's go over the words we just learned.


Are you interested in any of these sports? I think I might want to try rock climbing sometime, and there's an outdoor rock climbing gym nearby that I think I'll check out. Think about the sports that we learned today. Are there any you'd like to try?


How often do you go outside and experience nature? I've been going on hiking trips with my brother since we were little and we've seen all sorts of amazing things. Let's learn some sentences that will help us to when we experiencing the great outdoors.


Here's a hiking tip I learned: bring plenty of water and snacks, and don't hike alone. Hiking is a great way to experience nature, and these phrases will help you the next time you go outside. Let's practice them.


There are hiking trails for all levels of hikers, whether you're an expert or a beginner. Are there any hiking trails near you? Give yourself a chance to use what you learned in today's lesson by going for a hike or a long walk. Make sure you take some time to enjoy the scenery.


There are indoor people and outdoor people. I'm more of an indoor person, but I do enjoy going outside. What sore of person are you? Different people often have different hobbies, as we'll see in today's lesson. Listen closely.


Mondays, we have bowling.
Tuesdays, we play pool.
Wednesdays, we go dancing.
I can hardly keep track of it all!
It sounds so wonderful!
Well, you should be careful what you wish for!


I spent the entire weekend writing, it was very productive. What do you like doing in your spare time? Are you ready to go out and do some kind of hobby? We can't do that yet, but we do have to be careful to manage our time or we can get tired out. Let's go over today's lesson with an exercise.


What are your spare time interests? How do you enjoy your time? Talk to your friends about the hobbies you share. Do you have different hobbies? Then talk about why you like your hobbies -- maybe after talking, you can try something new!


Do any of those activities appeal to you? I'll be honest, I don't think air sports are my thing -- falling through the sky is more a nightmare than a dream for me. Personally, I prefer hot springs. It's time to check up on what you learned. Get ready for an exercise.


Plan out an adventure trip and think of things you might want to do. What would your days like? Hang gliding in the morning and rafting in the afternoon? A week of hiking and camping? See how many activities you can list.


I've been cooped in the city for too long, and I'm feeling the need to get some fresh air. When is the last time you enjoy some time outside? The outdoors can offer both adventure and peace of mind.

## Level 4

### Clothes

What clothes do you have on now? Are you comfortable with them? You've probably noticed that I enjoy my personal sense of style when it comes to clothing. What do you usually wear? The words in today's lesson will help you to shop for clothes wherever you go. Let's try it.

Have you ever asked a salesperson for help in a clothing store? They can also give you advice on what to wear. Alright, let's see how well you can find your way around a clothing store by finding the items in this picture.

Why don't you try people watching? Sit somewhere with a friend and notice well dressed people. Take note of the things you like which people are wearing. Maybe you can adopt some styles for yourself.

Do you like shopping for new clothes? How often do you buy new clothes? I like my wardrobe and don't buy new clothes all that often. Anyway, today we're going to work on sentences you can use when shopping for clothes.

I like to think that when people look at me, they see someone who's neat and cultured. Your clothes say a lot about who you are. What does your outfit say about you? Let's review shopping for clothes with this unscrambling exercise.

Go to a clothing store and practice by shopping around. Talk about the clothes around you and try some on. As long as you're practicing your description, you're on the right track.

Have you ever bought something and found it didn't fit, or that it didn't look as good at home as it did at the store? Feeling bad about something after you've bought it is called "buyer's remorse". Thankfully you can sometimes return or exchange what you bought back at the store, and we'll learn how to do that today.

Do you like your clothes? I've found that the most important thing about what you're wearing is that you think you look great in it. Now let's practice by doing this exercise.

For further practice, rehearse exchanging or returning clothing. Make sure you know what to say when you're unhappy with something your bought. That way you'll be prepared the next time you make a bad purchase.

Finding the right clothes can be a long process, especially when you're following someone who's being very picky.

It's hard to keep up with the latest fashion. That's why I keep a classic look -- don't you think it works for me?

Practice asking a salesperson about different clothes. You can ask for a different size of different cool. The next time you go shopping, think about how you would ask to find something you want.

When you're referring to an object or group of objects, you need to attach an article in order to specify which one. Articles can either be definite, "the", or indefinite, "a" or "an". They always come before nouns. We're going to work with three situations. First, we use the indefinite article "a/an" when we talk about one thing out of many and it doesn't matter which one. We'll use the definite article "the" when we're talking about something very specific, and we won't use an article at all when we're talking about a concept or something very general! Let's get to work!

When you point to something, you want people to know which one you're referring to. Determiners are the words that are used before a noun to determine the precise meaning of the noun! Determiners can be articles (a, an, the), demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those), possessive pronouns (my, your, his, hers, its, our, their), numerals or quantifiers. See, they let you know which one, how much of something, whose it is, and answer questions like that. Let's go over the rules and put them into practice.

Quantifiers are used to give information about how much of something there is. Some adjectives and adjectival phrases can only go with uncountable nouns, and some can only go with countable nous. The words in the middle column can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns. Look up in our grammar chart to see all categories.


### Accessories

Accessories can be all that stands between a good outfit and a great one. Also accessories can be practical; a watch can tell time, or a belt can hold your pants up.

### Shopping

It's important to try on clothes in the fitting room before you buy them. But whatever you wear, you can make it look good with the right amount of confidence. Let's practice the words by looking around a clothing store right now.

The next time you're at a clothing store, identify the things around you. Where are the fitting rooms? What are the mannequins wearing? Practice everywhere!

Which is better, shopping in shops or shopping online? As for me, I love receiving a package and opening it to find something I was waiting for. Do you ever order things online? Let's review with an exercise.

I was up all last night bidding on a rare book online, and I really hope I win. You can sometimes find great deals with online auctions. Let's take a look as Bobby tries to find a camera online.

TV shopping is another modern convenience. Thanks to TV shopping, many products are just a phone call away. Let's take a closer look at TV shopping in today's lesson.

It's about to do a writing exercise. Remember to use the vocabulary you used, and don't be afraid to learn from your mistakes. Also, try to write a strong concluding sentence. At this stage, your concluding sentence will be fine as long as it repeats the main idea. Good luck.


### Appliances

I use my coffee machine and toaster oven every day. How often do you use the appliances in your home? Do you cook a lot or just microwave your food? Let's practice our vocabulary words.

Every home is filled with appliances. Which on do you use most often? As I said, I could probably live with just my coffee machine and toast oven. When you go home today, see which ones are most important to you.

You should know exactly what you're looking for when you go shopping for appliances. Each appliance has many different features, and you don't want to be stuck with an appliance you don't need. In today's lesson you'll learn how to find the appliance that suits you best.

I do a fair amount of cooking, so I actually have a bundle of appliances to prepare different types of food. In college though, all I needed was a microwave, because I pretty much lived on cup noodles. Let's practice shopping for the right appliance.

What's the most useful appliance to you? If you could only keep one appliance, which one would it be? Think about it and come up with reasons why.

One of the first things when you move into a new place is to buy the appliances and things you'll need. Pay attention to the dialogues in today's lesson to learn how to shop for a new home.


Save your money for a rainy day.

Out with the old and in with the new.


I'm starting to think I need to redecorate my place! Maybe I need to get new drapes, or replace some of the furniture. Let's go over the lesson with an exercise.

I just moved a sofa from one end of my living room to another, and it makes the entire room look and feel bigger. What does your place look like now? How might you redecorate it? Take a look at your home and imagine how your might want to redecorate it.

I think it was smart of Ben to buy all that stuff. After all, a lot of those things they bought are things that Ben and Jenny will probably need anyway, like a refrigerator or a washing machine. Let's review the lesson.

You can call a few appliances by a shorter name. For example, TV instead of television, or fridge instead of refrigerator. This might make the appliances easier to remember. Keep reviewing your appliances!


### Exercise

How much do you exercise? Exercise is an important part of staying healthy. In this lesson, we're going to learn words that will help you out the next time you hit the gym.

Your body needs many different exercises so that it will stay healthy. What's your favorite exercise? Does it involve a certain piece of exercise equipment, or an exercise machine? Let's go over the gym equipment again.

I need to visit the gym sometime soon, I keep losing tennis matches to my friends and I need to get more fit. Go to the gym and work out! As you do, notice the machines that you use and remember what they're called.

Do you agree with the statement, "No pain, no gain"? I don't think it's necessary to kill yourself every time you work out, but  I think my workouts are more effective when I push myself a little. Let's learn more phrases that we can use at the gym.

The other day I didn't stretch after I finished working out at the gym. That was a big mistake -- I'm still feeling sore. Do you usually remember to stretch? Let's try an exercise right now that doesn't involve any stretching at all.

When I exercise, I use different machines like the rowing machine, or the treadmill. What kind of exercise do you do? Do you take any classes, like yoga, or maybe aerobic exercises? Identify the different exercises that you do when you work out.

A personal trainer can help you and give you advice. Kind of like me! I don't know if I can train you to exercise, but let's work together so that you'll know all the right words for the next time you work out.

Running works out your heart, while lifting weight improves your muscles. It's important to work out different parts of your body to stay fit. Now let's work on our speaking next.

Working out with a friend makes exercise more fun and interesting. Friends can push us to work harder and encourage us when we get tired. Find a friend who will work out with you and practice English with you. With today's words, you can do both at the same time!


One of the reason I don't like visiting the gym is because I can't help but compare myself to all the people around me, and I also worry about what other people are thinking of me. But the gym also has plenty of exercise equipment that I can't find at home. In today's lesson we'll look at some of the ups and downs of gyms, so let's get started.

A meat market is a place where meat is brought and sold. Of course, it's also a place where single people go to meet other single people. I guess the gym is kind of a meat market. Let's go over what we just saw in this next exercise.

What do you do for fun? The best way to exercise is by doing something that you like doing. What do you enjoy doing? Keep track of the activities that you do -- sports can be healthy and fun.


### Entertainment

What hobbies do you have? Why did you pick your hobby? Hobbies are an important part of life. Hobbies are essential for a good life. You can choose a hobby based on interests, tastes, skills, ambitions, or anything really. After all, you don't want to exhaust yourself with work. Hobbies help us recharge. Let's learn about a few of them now.

How do you like spend your free time? Do you like doing any of those activities? We might want to go off and do some of them immediately, but of now we have to be happy with just studying about them. Let's try it.

What are your plans for your next free day? Are you planning on something exciting, like mountain climbing, or something relaxing, like surfing the internet? Plan out your day and use these vocabulary words to help you.

What do you do in your leisure time? How often do you do it? Talking about your hobbies is almost as fun as actually doing them. Listen to the sentences in today's lesson for some ideas about how to talk about hobbies.

Do you like music? Music is a great hobby to have, whether you play it or just listen to it. My brother plays the oboe, and I play a bit of guitar.

Do you enjoy reading? My favorite is reading, because reading lets you live other people's lives and takes you to places that you can't normally go. What's your favorite hobby? Can you explain why you like it.


### Hobbies

Do you remember how you started doing your hobbies? I started playing tennis in High School because I thought it might be fun. What are some hobbies that you've dropped, and some that you've stuck with? Let's review Henry's hobby search.

What hobby would you like to take up? There sure are a lot -- explore a little and come up with the names of a few that you might be interested in doing. Who knows? Maybe you'll actually end up doing one of them.

Do you prefer to fill your free time up with hobbies just relax and do nothing? I usually like reading or playing tennis with a friend, but sometimes it can be nice to sit at home and relax.

One great thing about hobbies is that you can have hobbies for different occasions. Do you have different indoor and outdoor hobbies or different hobbies for the seasons?

Writing allows me to sort out my thoughts, and create whole worlds. What do you like about your hobbies? Try describing what you like about your favorite hobbies.


### Greeting & Visit

I have friends in Taipei and I visit it once in a while. I've seen a lot of the great cultural sights in Taipei, but every time I visit they still find somewhere new and amazing to take me. Let's learn some of them in this lesson.

I think museums are one of my favorite places to visit. I love art museums, natural history museums; I'll even go to children's museums! Exploring cultural sights is a great way to learn about history and see some incredible thing.

I was just at Kenting National Part last summer. We went camping, and we also visited the beach there -- it was a really fun trip. When is the last time you went somewhere fun? Can you describe the experience?

Greeting visitors and showing them around town is an important skill. It can give business partners a good impression or it can show friends how glad you are that they're visiting. We're going to learn some sentences that will help us do this.

I enjoy showing visitors around and giving tours. When I was a college student, I actually gave campus tours to new students. Are you ready to give visitors a friendly tour?

Is there anything in particular you'd like to see or do while you're here.

Are you prepared to show a visitor around your home town? What are the must see place in your area, and where would you take someone if you served as their guide? Plan out a trip and practice what you might say as you showed them around.

In cities like Taipei, beautiful historical sights are with walking distance of amazing modern marvels. But what sights do you prefer, the modern or the historical?

Personally, I prefer historical sights -- I think old buildings are very beautiful and filled with history. But modern buildings can be impressive too. After all, modern sights are just historical sights that haven't aged yet, right?

Knowing what kinds of places you want to see is important when you're planning your trip. Since I like historical sights, I often plan my trips around old buildings and battlefields. Plan out a trip somewhere and look up some places that interest you.

It's important to be polite when visiting a new place. You want to be considerable to the host and make sure you're invited back! Let's read this article about what to do when you're invited to a Christmas party.

How do you act when you visit someone's house? How about this one: Tell the host what great food or what a great party it is at the midpoint of the night and then again when you are saying your goodbye. Find out more tips and you'll be everyone's favorite guest. Let's go over it again with this exercise.

My cousin is an excellent guest. She's very polite and even helps with the dishes. Who are some of your favorite people to invite to your house? What do you think are the qualities that make a good guest?


### House rent
I live in a two bedroom apartment on the second floor of an apartment building. Sometimes though, I wish I lived in a bigger place, maybe a house with a yard. What kind of place do you live in? Is it an apartment or a house? Let's learn to identify some parts of a house.

I wish my place had a balcony or a yard. Even though I'd like to move into a house, I think I like living in the city too much. Is there anything you wish you had at your places?

Go home and see how many rooms of your house you can identify. Can you go though your house and name the different parts of it? With the words you learned you should be able to name a few more rooms.

Have you ever looked for a new place to move? You probably thought about things like how much could you comfortably afford and if your credit score was good enough to rent. What features were important to you? Let's learn how to search for a new living place in today's lesson.

Do you have a good idea of how to look for a new place? Practice speaking and soon you'll be able to find a house or apartment that's perfect for you.

What are the best features of the place you're living in? How about the worst features? Are you close to the subway? Do you have mice? Make a list of the critical requirements for your new neighborhood. Think about it and try to respond in English.

Moving all the stuff you have and signing a lease are parts of the process of moving into a new place. Do you know how to discuss moving and signing a lease?

Do you remember this sort of thing from the last time you moved? It's bringing back memories for me of looking for my apartment -- it sure was a lot of work. Let's review now with an exercise.

For some people, looking at open houses is a fun, leisure-time activity. Let's pretend you are talking with a moving company, or signing a lease with a landlord. This topic is very useful, and when the real thing happens, you'll be extra prepared.

Do you remember the last time you went house hunting? What should you look for when renting an apartment? Max and Jimmy are looking for a new place to move into.


## Level 5

### Secretes, rumours, and gossip

Like it or not, secrets, gossip, and rumours are just something we have to deal with. Today's words will give you the right sentences for when you find out something your probably shouldn't know.


Don't tell anybody.
I won't tell a soul.
This is between you and me.
She can't keep a secret.
This is for your ears only.
Don't say you heard it from me.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Don't breathe a word of this.
My lips are sealed.

Benjamin Franklin said, "Three can keep a secret if two are dead." I think I agree with him -- secrets have a way of getting out. While gossip can be fun to hear and spread around, it's less fun when you're the one being gossiped about. Let's practice dealing with gossip with this exercise.

Gossip can be a verb or a noun. You call the rumours that spread around gossip, but a person who spreads rumours around is called a gossip. Basically, a gossip spreads gossip. I think the best thing to do is to avoid gossips and gossip altogether and just keep secrets to myself.

Online chat is a way of communication by sending text messages to people in the same chat-room in real-time. There are all kinds of new words and ways to communicate. Let's read about some of them in today's lesson.

The Internet and cellphone texting are really changing language. And there are more functions available to us these days. Do you use IM or chatrooms? Do you use it to talk to friends or do you talk to strangers as well? Let's review the reading with an exercise.

The Internet makes it very easy to talk to people from across the world. There are plenty of places online where you can practice English by typing to other people. Go online and try it.


### Astrology

What's your start sign? I'm a Virgo, so I'm supposed to be neat, smart and loyal. Do you think that describes me? We'll learn more about astrological signs in this lesson.

Do you ever check your horoscope? Some people take astrology very seriously. Do you think it says something about who you are or do you think it's just silly? I don't usually believe in that stuff, but I still read my horoscope every day -- I don't want to take any chances! Let's try an exercise.

12 ones
Aires, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer
Lion,Virgo, Libra, Scorpio
Sagittarius, Capricom, Aquarius, Pisces

Find out the star signs of your friends. What personality traits and characters are they supposed to have? Do those personality traits match up with what you think of them?

Divination is the world for using signs, like start signs, to find out things that we might not otherwise know. Some of my friends take it pretty seriously, but I'm a little suspicious. What do you think? Let's listen to the dialogue.
