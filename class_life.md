 You can say "it is raining cats and dogs", if it's raining very heavy. Or you can also make sentences like: "We can't go now because it's raining cats and dogs." **You know, I really don't mind rain that much. Falling asleep to rain is actually quite enjoyable.** Try to describe the weather and understand the weather forecast on the news.

The weather can really affect my mind. I tend to be more thoughtful during rainy days and happier when it's sunny. Does the weather affect your emotions?
