# My Favorite Outdoor Activity

I enjoy a lot of outdoor activities. Swimming, cycling, jogging, boating and hiking are just a few. But among these, hiking is definitely my favorite.

First of all, hiking is one activity that I can enjoy during all four seasons. As long as I dress for the weather, I can go hiking in winter, spring, summer and fall.

Additionally, hiking helps me to relieve stress. I love to escape from the city to go hiking in the mountains. While hiking, my lungs take in the fresh air and I totally immerse myself in the beautiful surroundings. After a short time, my worries disappear and my mind feels calm and relaxed.

Finally, hiking is free. Anyone anywhere can enjoy the many benefits of hiking. All you have to do is slip on a pair of walking shoes and head out the door. With all of these great reasons to go hiking, why not give it a try today?
