### What does friendship mean to you?

Next to family, friends are the most important thing in the world. According to the dictionary, a friend is someone whom you know, like and trust. Unlike family, friends have chosen to know, like, and trust you. That's really important. Friends don't have to be nice to you, but they still are.

Some people say their best friend is their mom or dad, or brother or sister. Others say their friend is their dog or cat. But my best friend is an old classmate from cram school. I haven't seen her for years, but we still stay in touch by chatting on the Internet. Whenever I'm sad, she always asks me what's happened; when I'm happy, she's always excited to hear why.

I guess that's what friendship really is: it's having someone that cares enough to listen, and to share life's ups and downs with you. A friend who can stick by you through think and thin is a true friend indeed.
