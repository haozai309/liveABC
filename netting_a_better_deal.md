## Netting a Better Deal

Booking a hotel room online is convenient, but, before you key in your credit card number, take a closer look; if the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Make sure to read the following advice before you pay:

### Location

If the online booking service states that the hotel has a "great view" or is "five minutes from the beach", use an online map to check; that "great view" could be of the parking lot, and the hotel might be five minutes from the beach by taxi!

### Transportation

Will the hotel send a minibus to the airport to pick you up? Is the transportation complimentary, or are there hidden charges? You don't want to spend the first day of your holiday stuck at the airport. Call or e-mail the booking service to get more information.

### Traveler's Reviews

Learn from the experiences of others: There are many forums online where travellers post their reviews about hotels, beaches, and services. The hotel you want might look good in pictures, but if other travellers are complaining about it, you might want to think again.

### Deposits and Fees

Some hotels ask for a nonrefundable room deposit before they can confirm your booking, but others might return your deposit as long as you cancel at least a day or two before the booked date. Read the find print, or you could lose a hefty sum!
