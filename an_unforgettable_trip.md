## An Unforgettable Trip

Last year, my family and I took a trip to Paris. While Paris is famous for many things, I will always remember the city's art and food.

Paris has always been a centre of art, and the city has many museums and galleries. My favorite museum was the Louvre. It was full of great art. Seeing the Mona Lisa up close took my breath away.

Besides seeing the wonderful art, I also enjoyed eating in Paris. French cuisine is world renowned, and the many baked goods in Paris are certainly special. I'll never forget the first time I visited a small French bakery and took my first bite of a fresh baguette.

It has been over a year since my family and I visited Paris, but I will always remember the city and its wonderful art and food.
